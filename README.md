# About the application

You work for a very big legal company with about 50,000 employees globally that is very serious on privacy and non disclosure and intellectual property protection. Lawyers on different teams usually share a lot of memos and snippets of old cases and reports. A member of the team discovers [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) but due to concerns on violating the companyâ€™s privacy policy decides against using it. Instead they come to you to build something similar for use within the company.

You are saddled with working on the API while a colleague builds the web frontend. 
The service should take a bunch of text and return a short url to the caller.
The service should allow you to set an expiry for content so that it self destructs after the said expiry date, however, expiry is optional.
